Setup for a  proper project in typescript

By the command 

tsc --init 

i will make the tsconfig.json file conatinning all the configurations

Main configurations

1.target 

we will it that compiles the ts code in es6 js 

2.rootDir(for ts files)

in which direc your ts file is 

generally we make src folder and put the ts file in it

3.outDir(for js files)

generally we make dist folder and put the js file in it


After doing all of these

you can only use the command

tsc

it will automatically go in the src folder and will compile the ts file

and you can see it will create the .js.map file in the dist folder by the source map which is true

Modify your index.html file directory of .js file


tsc --watch 0r --w get rid of typing again tsc for each compilation
