In this class I have learnt that when you are working with Javascript it allows you to put the value of any type don't restrict you from doing that which causes the major

bugs in the development phase then we have to later debug that bugs but what if you get to know your bugs or mistakes hand in hand. Now here typescript comes in the

picture, it is the superset of javascript the deficiencies remained in javascript it is built to resolve these. Although javascript is a scripting language so we

need to use the Typescript with the javascript which mainly trackle with the types if javascript and prevent you from making mistakes. The typescript simply later

converted in the javascript because our browser understands javascript not the typescript. So we work on the typescript the then typescript convert our typescript

into javascript whivh then executed by the browser. It is much important as the freelancers expect the javasctipt developer to be have expertise on javascript.

It is also involving in the upcoming Web 3.0

Today, I have learnt how can i verify the elements that i called from the HTML in the js file and more specifically then verify them as they are like inputElement

Then get to know how can i restrict the types of the variables from preventing to reassign from the other types

Futhermore, explored the other types like strings,numbers and lastly how can i firsly define the type of the array either it is array of strings or numbers

That's All

Feeling luckily to learn these things in much understandable way by the most senior trainer of SMIT "Sir Ishaq Bhojani"
